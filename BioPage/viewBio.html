                <h1>A brief history of who I am</h1>
                <p>Always being fascinated by the unknown, I was a curious child. Every time I saw 
                    something new, I am filled with excitement to learn about what it does and why it does it. 
                    I wanted to learn all about how it worked and what it can do. It was not until high school that 
                    I realized I loved learning about technology and how it worked. Before starting college, I could 
                    not decide between staying at my current course, BS Physics, or shifting to a much more hands-on 
                    with technology course in the field of IT. So, I decided that if I enjoyed my first year in physics 
                    during college, I would stick to that course. And so, our second term in physics came and had a 
                    programming class. It was during this class that I realized that it was not the theories that excited 
                    me but instead, it was my laziness for wanting to automate things and making life much more comfortable. 
                    And that is when I decided that I want to study Computer Science. 
                    And now that I am here, I can see that I am developing the skill required to make life easier.
                     And in the future, I want to leave this earth knowing that I made it a much more comfortable world for everyone.
